In our first official meeting, we overview 1) how mesh networks work, 2) Raul Enrequez from [Community Tech NY](http://communitytechny.org/) and David Johnson with [iNethi](https://www.inethi.org.za/) speak on their community network projects, and 3) Fraca Muller of the [Baltimore Teachers Union](https://www.baltimoreteachers.org/) and Andrew Coy of the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/) speak on their digital inclusion efforts in Baltimore, and 4) we begin conversations about Philly Wisper in Philadelphia.

1. In Community Tech NY, multiple communities around the city decide where a network goes and builds it jointly. In the last five years, they have set up networks in Kingston NY and rural Tennessee, largely using a portable network kit. A problem that they noted was that landlords want to charge a lot for their roof space for antenna installs because of Big ISPs paying them.

2. David Johnson of iNethi, discusses making network communities in rural South Africa, where a large financial burden exists for many users. Without a community network, low-income users typically pay more but with the network, iNethi allows users to share content directly and cheaply with the goal of having community social platforms to replace Facebook and YouTube. With iNethi, the community is trained on network hardware installation from scratch which they complete. There are 8 mesh nodes using Libre Mesh set up in Cape Town using open-source software on Ubiquiti hardware.

3. In Baltimore, the [Digital Harbor Foundation](https://www.digitalharbor.org/) partnered with the school system which advocated to garner \$3 million from the City of Baltimore for the project with several pilot schools. The Digital Harbor Foundation transformed a rec center to a tech center for youth. In this project, they have been planning to use the public schools as points to create the mesh network, with public schools serving as primary access/relay points. A cost estimate is \$38,684 for ~800 installs. The goal is to reach 100,000 people with this network in Baltimore.

The specifics of Baltimore's access points include 1) sector antennae connected to a receiver located on a house, 2) omni-directional antennae in key areas like courtyards/parks, and 3) blanket connectivity with line of sight from sector anntennae.

4. In Philadelphia, [Philly Wisper](https://phillywisper.net/) has [four major high sites](https://www.inquirer.com/philly/business/technology/phillywisper-comcast-verizon-high-speed-internet-20180129.html) and a number of minor sites, with 10GB points of connection with major providers. [Internet is finally part of the city's priorities.](https://www.inquirer.com/education/coronavirus-students-digital-divide-philadelphia-comcast-20200403.html) A suggestion was to look for areas with the least access and find public properties and community properties (churches, mosques) in the vicinity as install sites.
