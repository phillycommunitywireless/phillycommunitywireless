## 1. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT {#30j0zll}

We collect two basic types of information from you when you provide it
to us or when you use or interact with our Services: personal
information and non-personal information.

Personal information includes all information that relates to you or
which are opinions about you personally and either identifies or may be
used to identify you personally (collectively, "**personal
information**"). We may collect the following types of personal
information from you depending upon the device you are using and how you

  information.

  browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform,
  device type and device identifiers.

Non-personal information includes information that does not personally
identify you or information that has been anonymized (collectively,
"**non-personal information**"). When we combine non-personal
information with personal information, we treat the combined information
as personal information.

You can always refuse to provide your personal information, but please
note that some personal information is necessary to provide our
Services.
