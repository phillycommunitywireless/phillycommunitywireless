**[We're hiring a full-time paid project manager!](/job)**

**Philly Community Wireless** (PCW) is building community-owned and -operated internet infrastructures in order to democratize information access, promote digital literacy, and fight digital inequity with free, net-neutral broadband service in North Philadelphia.
