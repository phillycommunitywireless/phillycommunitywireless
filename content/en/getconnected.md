    Our installation and service is free, but as a host of our network equipment, you're a key part of our community! We'd love to get to know you more and stay in touch. We ask that all our antenna hosts share information about our work with neighbors, participate in our community events, and get involved in other ways."

<!-- # The Installation Process

Philly Community Wireless works with [PhillyWisper](https://phillywisper.net), a local wireless internet service provider, to install rooftop antennas that we use to provide a free wifi network to the neighborhood residents and public spaces. You can help your neighbors by using your residential building as a hub for neighbors to access this free network. For more information on what a rooftop install involves, visit our [Antenna Installation documentation](https://github.com/phillycommunitywireless/docs/blob/main/docs/installations.md).

<!-- # Timeline

Installations can sometimes take an extended period of time to schedule and complete, up to several months. We are expanding our network coverage every week, but we have more demand than we can meet and a variety of obstacles, including line of sight, can impede our network's reach. We appreciate your patience and assistance as we build the foundations of our network. Please reach out to volunteer for a rooftop antenna, and we will work with you to provide you and your neighbors with free wifi service as soon as we can. 

If you are currently outside our service area, we encourage you to still reach out if you need help accessing digital resources. We also encourage you to check out [available resources in Philadelphia](https://phillycommunitywireless.org/resources/) for accessing affordable computers, internet, and training in digital skills.  -->
