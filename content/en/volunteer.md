We love volunteers! We formed as a grassroots, entirely volunteer-led coalition working to build community controlled wireless internet networks in Philadelphia. We now have a dedicated team of staff and processes for onboarding volunteers from the Philly area and beyond to contribute to the organization and our network's growth in a variety of ways. Below we've outlined some of the ways that volunteers can contribute.

We welcome you to get involved in whatever capacity makes sense for you._{{% /notice %}}
