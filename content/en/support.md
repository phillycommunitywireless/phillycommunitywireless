We believe that internet access is a human right.

Since 2020, our work has proven that when community members come together to construct, expand, and leverage shared wireless internet networks, tens of thousands of people can access the internet in private and public spaces.

Having internet access is essential to take part in everyday opportunities and activities. Your support for our work ensures that everyone can access online health, education, employment, and civic resources.
