## Act on Air: The Philly Air Monitor Project

Philly Community Wireless has been working since 2023 to deploy [PurpleAir monitors](https://www2.purpleair.com/) on our public network. Since 2023, we have installed over a dozen air monitors in the North Philadelphia neighborhoods of Norris Square, Fairhill, and Kensington  at several install sites around our network to provide real-time air monitoring.  

## Measuring Air Quality

[Purple air monitors](https://www2.purpleair.com/) enable communities to engage in citizen science around pollution in their neighborhoods. 

1. If their air quality is good in their area
2. How it compares to other parts of the city.
