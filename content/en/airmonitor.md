## Act on Air: The Philly Air Monitor Project

Philly Community Wireless has been working since 2023 to deploy [PurpleAir monitors](https://www2.purpleair.com/) on our public network. Since 2023, we have installed over a dozen air monitors in the North Philadelphia neighborhoods of Norris Square, Fairhill, and Kensington  at several install sites around our network to provide real-time air monitoring.  

## Measuring Air Quality

[Purple air monitors](https://www2.purpleair.com/) enable communities to engage in citizen science around pollution in their neighborhoods, helping folks understand: 

1. If the air quality is good or not good in their area
2. How it compares to other parts of the city

Real-time air quality data can be viewed on [PurpleAir's map](https://map.purpleair.com/).
