## [Philly Community Wireless Wifi Coverage Map](https://map.phillycommunitywireless.org/)

<iframe title="Philly Community Wireless network-hardware deployment map" role="img" aria-label="A map showing currently installed Philly Community Wireless network infrastructure, centered on Norris Square Park."src="https://map.phillycommunitywireless.org/" width="100%" height="400"/></iframe>
  
This map focuses on showing the overall network architecture. Icons on the map show PhillyWisper high sites, Wi-Fi access points, routers, point-to-point equipment, and mesh nodes. Other features show connections between devices, a timeline to see our network's growth over the years, and a heatmap.

Areas covered by the heatmap should have PCW signal available for a free Wi-Fi connection, but please keep in mind that it may not be accurate at street-level. If you cannot access the Wi-Fi network at a location covered by the heatmap here, you may need to walk around a street corner. Try to find the closest access point visible to ensure a good connection.

## Guided Tour
