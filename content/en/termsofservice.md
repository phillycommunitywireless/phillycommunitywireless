The Philly Community Wireless Project, a fiscally sponsored project of the Movement Alliance Project (“PCWP”) and its backhaul provider, PhillyWisper (“PW”), support net neutrality and a free and open Internet without throttling, zero-rating, or tracking people’s usage for money, advertising, or other forms of consideration. For this reason, PCWP, with PW’s support, provides access to a wireless Internet connection free of charge to residents of Philadelphia while they are within range of our network (the “Service”). Because access to the Internet should be a human right enjoyed by all, PCWP will never require means testing or ask anyone to prove their need. The Service is intended to provide access to the public Internet, including for e-mail and web browsing.
