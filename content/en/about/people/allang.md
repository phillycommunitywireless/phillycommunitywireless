Allan Gomez is the Systems Adminstrator for Philly Community Wireless. With PCW, he helps manage and expand a growing community wifi network in Philadelphia. He also helps to build engagement and ownership with community members. The work that he does with PCW overlaps nicely with his past experiences of building low-power FM radio stations throughout Latin America and the United States. In addition, he makes a Sisyphean effort at raising his two daughters cross-culturally with a strong commitment to justice and solidarity, and a love of music, art, and science.
