A Canadian, Leanne came to Philadelphia in 2021 to pursue a Master’s of Science in Communication for Development and Social Change at Temple University. Interested in digital equity and the link between digital spaces and healthy democracy, Leanne began volunteering with PCW in Summer 2023, quickly becoming quite active in the organization and passionate about its alternative vision for transforming digital inclusion through community wifi. She is excited to learn and grow alongside community members, local leaders, and her colleagues.  

Outside of PCW, Leanne’s interests include camping and hiking, writing, and obsessing over other people’s dogs.
