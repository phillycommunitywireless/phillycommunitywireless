## Vision

The Covid-19 pandemic dramatically demonstrated the implications of the digital divide and exacerbated existing inequalities for students, business owners, job seekers, and many others. Our vision extends beyond the COVID-19 crisis and the emergencies initiatives put into place. We seek a long term, sustainable, and affordable Internet for all in Philadelphia, rather than stopgap measures.

The Philly Community Wireless project is actively seeking to connect homes in the Norris Square, Fairhill, and Kensington neighborhoods of North Philadelphia to free, net-neutral broadband for at least the next decade. We strive to offer an alternative model for Internet access and to help cities and communities rethink about the Internet as a public utility by involving our users in the construction of the network.

Our goal is to help communities reclaim power through critical digital literacies. As PCW builds towards community-oriented stewardship, we welcome community members to learn and participate in the basic principles of network engineering and digital literacy so that they can be stewards of the technology, rather than merely recipients.

## Values

**We believe** that access to the Internet is a fundamental human right and that independent, community-owned and -operated wireless is a sustainable and scaleable means of digital inclusion.

**We support** net neutrality principles and believe that the Internet should be provided free of throttling, [zero-rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-rating), and the tracking and monetization of user behavior.

**We believe** that people matter more than profit and that the principles of cooperation and mutual aid can grow a fundamentally different kind of digital network.

Finally, **we believe** in starting small, learning from our mistakes, and inviting the input and perspectives of teachers, organizers, users, and technologists alike in building this network.

## Community Technology

Community-managed and owned wireless networks have cropped up across the United States in the last couple decades. Philly Community Wireless is inspired by similar projects in New York City, Detroit, Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and other cities across America. We are indebted to the work and documentation available on [NYC Mesh's website](https://www.nycmesh.net/).

Visit our [Docs](https://docs.phillycommunitywireless.org/en/latest/) for more info on the technical infrastructure and process.

In 2022, the Big Picture Alliance completed a documentary film about the early stages of the PCW project and the larger mission of community technology and digital equity work today. Check it out on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcReKkPl-6M).

## What We Need

> <p class="f3"><i>"Roughly $200 can permanently connect a house to high-speed Internet, with no monthly bills."</i></p>

#### Antenna Hosts

We work with community organizations and building owners in the Fairhill and Kensington neighborhoods who are willing to host network antennas on their rooftops and conduct community outreach about this free network connection. Please [sign up](https://tally.so/r/mR8VM9) if you would like to connect with us.

#### Volunteers

We always welcome interested community organizations and residents to get involved with any aspect of the project and learn as you contribute. For more info on roles for volunteers and onboarding processes, see our [Volunteer page](https://phillycommunitywireless.org/volunteer/) 

#### Fundraising

We are looking for additional funding to purchase more hardware that will be donated to community members, including alternative technologies that could supplement our baseline service. Please visit our [Allyra](https://phillycommunitywireless.wedid.it/) page to contribute! If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email us at info@phillycommunitywireless.org.
