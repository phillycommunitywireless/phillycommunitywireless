      <h2 id="values-of-participation">Values of Participation</h2>
<p><strong>This is a safe space.</strong> We encourage discussion of sensitive and difficult topics so that we can support each other and problem solve together. At the same time, we strive to uphold spaces where people with a plurality of voices and experiences can participate in full. Due to the sensitive or private nature of some elements of the project, please be cognizant to avoid sharing identifying information, and remember that anything you do share is seen by other people.</p>
<p><strong>Show up.</strong> We value all forms of participation, but the most important way to participate is through in-person participation by volunteering time, at events and meetings, as possible. We get things done by people showing up.</p>
<p><strong>Expect best intentions.</strong> Aspire to acting in friendship‚Äîmake PCW comfortable, welcoming, supportive, respectful, sincere, and open. Trust intent, name impact. Trust that everyone in this group has each other&rsquo;s best interests at heart; but if someone says something incorrect or hurtful, name what impact that has. Report hateful or violent behavior, comments, discussions, or actions to the committee dedicated to handling these reports. See more details on that process below.</p>
<p><strong>Stay open and flexible.</strong> Speak up and have your voice heard, but also be cognizant of how much space you&rsquo;re occupying and exercise your listening skills when needed. In technical discussions, we ask that members belonging to historically overrepresented groups (especially men) are careful to check their egos and actively make space for others. Our goal is to build functional infrastructure: be a plumber, not a rockstar.</p>
<p><strong>Keep feedback constructive.</strong> We value honesty, but only for the purpose of improvement, not for the sake of cruelty. On the opposite side of the spectrum, sugar-coating feedback in order to spare someone‚Äôs feelings is not necessarily constructive either. The goal is to be supportive, honest, and thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>Keep discussion relevant.</strong> Work to stay on-topic and take digressing conversations into other spaces‚Äîa Slack channel, email or Signal thread, separate meeting, etc.</p>
<h2 id="harassment-and-abuse">Harassment and Abuse</h2>
<p>We believe disagreement and differences of opinion are a natural part of a community and are important to work through when building, strategizing, and learning from one another, but <strong>we do not tolerate harassment or abuse in any form.</strong> Participants who engage in harassment or abuse may be removed from the group at the discretion of the organizers. Reports of harassment will be implicitly trusted and investigated thoroughly.</p>
<p>Harassment includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person‚Äôs lifestyle choices and practices</li>
<li>Deliberate intimidation or antagonism</li>
<li>Exclusionary jokes or comments</li>
<li>Unwelcome sexual attention or physical contact</li>
<li>Sustained disruption of meetings, events, or online discussion</li>
<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease</li>
<li>Comments that reinforce social structures of domination (related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion)</li>
<li>Threats of violence</li>
</ul>
<p>Abuse includes, but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trolling, misdirection, and disrespectful use of resources and access</li>
<li>Use of existing unequal or oppressive social dynamics (cultural, gender or class differences, etc) to exert power over another person</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have been harassed or have witnessed abuse, please bring this to the attention of a member of the steering committee. Every participant is responsible for taking action if they witness or become aware of abuse or harassment, and to invoke a mediator and confidant to take next steps - not just the target or most impacted person is responsible to report it.</p>
<p>Organizers should take appropriate, usually private, action if any abuse or harassment is reported to them or they hear about or witness any such abuse or harassment. They must be sensitive to cultural differences, but take prompt action when necessary.</p>
