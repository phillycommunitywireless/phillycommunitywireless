        <h2 id="what-is-philly-community-wireless">What is Philly Community Wireless?</h2>
<p>Philly Community Wireless is a project to develop community-owned mesh networks in North Philly. We are a working group of organizers, technologists, academics, public school teachers, and City Hall staffers in Philadelphia. During a time of social distancing and online teaching, roughly half of the city’s public school students lack a wifi connection at home. In certain neighborhoods, even more residents lack any connection to the Internet. We seek to address the city&rsquo;s digital divide with community-owned and -operated mesh network technologies.</p>
<p>Mesh networks allow a single Internet connection to be shared among a broader group of users with very little cost or infrastructure required. With the help of PhillyWisper, a pro-net neutrality, wireless internet service provider, we are working toward installing two pilot sites in Kensington and Fairhill. From there, we will plan participatory design workshops and technical training for the community that will empower them to maintain and grow this free network connection.</p>
<h2 id="why-is-philly-community-wireless-making-a-mesh-network-in-norris-square-park">Why is Philly Community Wireless making a mesh network in Norris Square Park?</h2>
<p>Building the project in Norris Square Park helps our organization build conversations between PCW and representatives from Latinx community organizations in Norris Square, which also stand to benefit from free internet. Not only will individuals gain access in their own homes, allowing them to do schoolwork, apply for jobs, and access online English classes, among other activities; community organizations can also expand programming, including live-streamed cooking and pottery classes or outdoor study spaces for students using computers.</p>
<p>Just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a detailed study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that a mere 53% of Black residents and 44% of Latinx residents in Philadelphia have broadband connections (Alvaro 2020). The pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the implications of this digital divide and exacerbated existing inequalities for students, business owners, job seekers, and many others.</p>
<h2 id="what-areas-of-the-norris-square-park-neighborhood-currently-have-wifi">What areas of the Norris Square Park neighborhood currently have wifi?</h2>
<p>The free public wifi network should be accessible in most areas of Norris Square Park. A two-year grant from the Digital Literacy Alliance is enabling us, in the first year, to connect at least 100 homes within a one-mile radius around Norris Square to high-speed internet, at no cost to the users, for at least the next decade (the length of the agreement with our bandwidth provider, PhillyWisper). Neighboring streets are currently receiving wifi, as will many of the homes and buildings in the area. For updates on upcoming installs and service expansions, <a href="https://phillycommunitywireless.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7a97e4278a5833f5505a85940&amp;id=6af414f631">sign up for our newsletter</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>For technical information on the project, please see our <a href="https://docs.phillycommunitywireless.org/en/latest/">Docs page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-sign-up-to-get-connected">How do I sign up to get connected?</h2>
<p>If you would like to host a rooftop antenna or a mesh kit in your home, please fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfjx0A9mFxMiXSb1jisgcHFHwTzktsuz4c36Ja1tVOQjjXzow/viewform">join form</a> and look for an email with next steps.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, or would like to volunteer with Philly Community Wireless, reach out via email at <a href="mailto:phillycommunitywireless@gmail.com">phillycommunitywireless@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-actually-free-will-it-always-be-free">Is this actually free? Will it always be free?</h2>
<p>Yes, as long as PCW exists. We will never ask for your payment information.</p>
<h2 id="how-faststable-will-the-connection-be">How fast/stable will the connection be?</h2>
<p>We can’t promise consistent connection in any given area, but we aim to provide at least 25 mbps download speed in public and private spaces. Many areas of our network currently receive higher download speeds.</p>
<h2 id="who-do-i-contact-if-things-go-down">Who do I contact if things go down?</h2>
<p>Please contact us via (215) 316-5761 or email at <a href="mailto:phillycommunitywireless@gmail.com">phillycommunitywireless@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-secure-is-the-network-who-can-access-our-information-can-anyone-log-in-to-our-wifi">How secure is the network? Who can access our information? Can anyone log in to our wifi?</h2>
<p>We don’t track user activity. We support net neutrality principles and believe that the Internet should be provided free of throttling, zero-rating, and the tracking and monetization of user behavior.</p>
<p>By joining our network you agree to extend it to others. When connecting through the mesh from the street you should use the same standard precautions as you would when connecting to WiFi at a coffee shop or airport: use https (lock icon) web sites for secure connections (most browsers do this by default nowadays), or use a VPN service.</p>
<h2 id="can-i-get-hacked--is-my-personal-information-protected">Can I get hacked / is my personal information protected?</h2>
<p>Nothing you do on the internet should be considered fully “private.”</p>
<h2 id="will-my-activity-or-data-on-the-internet-be-tracked-by-a-third-party">Will my activity or data on the internet be tracked by a third party?</h2>
<p>No.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-your-user-data-policy">What is your user data policy?</h2>
<p>Please see our <a href="https://phillycommunitywireless.org/privacy/">Privacy page</a>.</p>
<h2 id="if-i-host-an-antenna-on-my-roof-how-does-this-affect-the-structural-integrity-of-my-house-will-extra-drilling-be-involved">If I host an antenna on my roof, how does this affect the structural integrity of my house? Will extra drilling be involved?</h2>
<p>Some homes will only need an indoor mesh antenna, plugged into a wall outlet. For homes that require a rooftop installation, an antenna will be attached to a chimney, or secured between cement blocks etc. Whenever possible we use non-penetrating roof mounts. Cables can be run into existing holes in your house. For more information, see our <a href="https://docs.phillycommunitywireless.org/en/latest/rooftop%20installation/">Docs page on rooftop installations</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-long-can-i-stay-connected-to-the-network">How long can I stay connected to the network?</h2>
<p>Outside of 9-5 PM work hours, in order to avoid unintentional consumption of broadband, we will reset connections after 6 hours, requiring users to reconnect to the wifi.</p>
