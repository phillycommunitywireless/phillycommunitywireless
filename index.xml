Vision Just before the COVID-19 pandemic hit, a detailed study published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that a mere 53% of Black residents and 44% of Latinx residents in Philadelphia have broadband connections (Alvaro 2020). The pandemic has dramatically demonstrated the implications of this digital divide and exacerbated existing inequalities for students, business owners, job seekers, and many others.</description>

      <description>What is Philly Community Wireless? Philly Community Wireless is a project to develop community-owned mesh networks in North Philly. We are a working group of organizers, technologists, academics, public school teachers, and City Hall staffers in Philadelphia. During a time of social distancing and online teaching, roughly half of the cityâ€™s public school students lack a wifi connection at home. In certain neighborhoods, even more residents lack any connection to the Internet.</description>

      <description>Our network is being built by and for our communities. To get involved, just reach out to one of our team leads based on your area(s) of interest.
Tech The tech team is primarily looking for volunteers who can donate time and effort to our installation process: attending in-person trainings and workdays in Norris Square, configuring our networking hardware, and installing equipment in homes and on rooftops. We are all in the process of learning these skills, so you&amp;rsquo;ll be trained in a collaborative environment.</description>
