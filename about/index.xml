      <description>Who are we? What is Philly Community Wireless? Philly Community Wireless is a community organization developing community-owned networks in North Philadelphia. We are a working group of organizers, technologists, academics, teachers, and community members in Philadelphia. We seek to address the city&amp;rsquo;s digital divide with community-controlled mesh network technologies.
Mesh networks allow a single Internet connection to be shared among a broader group of users with very little cost or infrastructure required.</description>
