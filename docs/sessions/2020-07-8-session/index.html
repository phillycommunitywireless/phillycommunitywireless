    <p>In this meetings, we 1) reviewed website updates 2) further defined the project&rsquo;s scope,  and 3) discussed measurement metrics for broadband.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We discussed what we can put on the website to involve the community, invite more people join our mailing list and weekly meetings. New volunteers need to be able to get up to speed with our progress, as well as the public and community needs to understand how decisions are being made. From now on and retroactively, session notes will be <a href="https://phillycommunitywireless.com/sessions/">public</a>. Going forward, having community members update the website themselves will be explored once projects are closer to implementation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given the broad goal of delivering internet to those in need, the scope of the project needs to be defined to understand what immediate steps are to be taken. We identified many essential services dependent on internet such as food distribution, telehealth, school, and government benefits. We discussed such priorities and goals  as filling in existing gaps in the existing networks, reaching students before the fall school season starts. The scale of the project was tentatively determined to create a pilot project in North Philly neighborhoods and scale up depending on what works.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trying to determine what works led us to discuss what metrics we use to measure success. Broadband connectivity data is under-measured from both the government and corporate side, but academic research projects such as the <a href="https://www.measurementlab.net/">Measurement Lab</a> are providing alternatives. Identifying who has internet and who does not is very difficult: if an ISP provides service to one house in a census block, the entire census block is reported as connected. This lack of data makes measuring this project&rsquo;s success difficult as well. Determining what is &ldquo;fast&rdquo; internet is also difficult; the FCC broadband definition is around 30 mb, but we need to determine immediate community needs.</p>
