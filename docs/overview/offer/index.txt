What We Offer
01.01.2020 00:00

We offer one-hour consultations on a variety of DH research or professional development questions, from mapping to text analysis, 3D modeling to design. Individuals can request no more than one session per month. We ask that requests for consultations come only from individuals at colleges or universities who do not currently have the digital humanities infrastructure in place to support their work.
