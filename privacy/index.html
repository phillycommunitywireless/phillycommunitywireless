<h2 id="30j0zll">1. TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
<p>We collect two basic types of information from you when you provide it
to us or when you use or interact with our Services: personal
information and non-personal information.</p>
<p>Personal information includes all information that relates to you or
which are opinions about you personally and either identifies or may be
used to identify you personally (collectively, &ldquo;<strong>personal

information from you depending upon the device you are using and how you

device type and device identifiers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Non-personal information includes information that does not personally
identify you or information that has been anonymized (collectively,
&ldquo;<strong>non-personal information</strong>&rdquo;). When we combine non-personal
information with personal information, we treat the combined information
as personal information.</p>
<p>You can always refuse to provide your personal information, but please
note that some personal information is necessary to provide our
Services.</p>
<h2 id="lnxbz9">2. HOW WE COLLECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We need to collect personal information from you in order to provide you

<p><em><strong>Cookies</strong></em></p>
<p>Like many websites and apps, we use &ldquo;cookies&rdquo;, which are small text
files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit
certain online pages that record your preferences and actions, including
how you use the website. We use this information for analytics purposes
which allows us to improve your browsing experience. The information we
collect through these technologies will also be used to manage your

cookies, if you opt-out from cookies, or if you set your browser or

<p><em><strong>Online Analytics</strong></em></p>
<p>We also use various types of online analytics on our website. These

applicable local law, we may provide you with the opportunity to
participate in surveys, some of which might be sponsored or conducted by
a third party. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary.
If you choose to participate, we will request certain personal
information from you. If there is a third party sponsor involved in the
survey, we may provide certain personal information with the third party
sponsor. Please make sure to review the sponsor&rsquo;s privacy policy and be
aware that any surveys offered by us may be governed by specific rules

<p>We share non-personal information with third parties as reasonably
necessary to meet our organizational needs.</p>
<h2 id="35nkun2">5.  HOW WE PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
<p>We are dedicated to ensuring the security of your personal information.
We use physical, electronic, and administrative security measures
appropriate to the risks and sensitivity of the personal information we
collect. We aim to provide secure transmission of your personal
information from your devices to our servers. We have processes to store
personal information that we have collected in secure operating
environments. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally
request proof of identity before we disclose your personal information
to you. We try our best to safeguard personal information once we
receive it, but please understand that no transmission of data over the
Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100%
secure. If you suspect an unauthorized use or security breach of your
personal information, please <a href="#z337ya">contact us</a> immediately.</p>
<h2 id="1ksv4uv">6.  CHILDREN&rsquo;S PRIVACY</h2>
<p>Our Services are not for children or those under the age of 13. We do
not knowingly collect personal information from children or other
persons who are under 13 years of age. Individuals who are children or
those under the age of 13 should not attempt to provide us with any
personal information. If you think we have received personal information
from children or those under the age of 13, please <a href="#z337ya">contact us</a> immediately.</p>
<h2 id="1fob9te">7.  YOUR CHOICES</h2>
<p><em><strong>Email Communications / Direct Marketing</strong></em></p>
<p>You may have the opportunity to receive certain communications from us
related to our Services. If you provide us with your email address in
order to receive communications, you can opt-out of marketing emails at
any time by following the instructions at the bottom of our emails and
adjusting your email preferences. Please note that certain emails
may be necessary for the operation of our Services. You will continue to
receive these necessary emails, if lawful and appropriate, even if you
unsubscribe from our optional marketing communications.</p>
<p><em><strong>Cookies / Beacons</strong></em></p>
<p>If you wish to minimize information collected by cookies or beacons, you
can adjust the settings of your device or browser. You can also set your
device or browser to automatically reject any cookies. You may also be
able to install plug-ins and add-ins that serve similar functions.
However, please be aware that some Services may not work properly if you
reject cookies.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do Not Track</strong></em></p>
<p>Some devices and browsers support a &ldquo;Do Not Track&rdquo; (or, DNT) feature, a
privacy preference that you can set in certain browsers, which is
intended to be a signal to websites and services that you do not wish to
be tracked across different websites or online services you visit.</p>
<p>Please note that we cannot control how third party websites or online
services you visit through our website respond to Do Not Track signals.
Check the privacy policies of those third parties for information on
their privacy practices. Our Services do not currently change the way
they operate upon detection of a <a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0042-online-tracking">Do Not
Track</a>
or similar signal.</p>
