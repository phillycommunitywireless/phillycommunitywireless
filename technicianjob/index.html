<h1 id="technician">Technician</h1>
<h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are:</h2>
<p>We are a volunteer-led coalition of technologists and organizers working to build community controlled wireless internet networks in Philadelphia. We are committed to growing tech literacy, expanding internet access, and building community autonomy with our neighbors. We believe that internet access is a human right. We work to build out the physical infrastructure along with community engagement with the network. Our goal is to make a robust wifi network managed by the people that use it.</p>
<h2 id="who-were-looking-for">Who we’re looking for:</h2>
<p>As a part of the Philly Community Wireless team, you’ll be the Technician. You will be part of our team that designs, organizes and carries out internet installations, network maintenance, as well as community training and engagement across our network in Northern Philadelphia. A key element of this work will involve preparing the gear, configuring devices, assessing and visiting install locations, installing equipment, and guiding volunteers through installations at community members’ homes.</p>
<p>You’ll need to have strong time management skills, a knack for troubleshooting, and the ability to juggle multiple projects at once. In addition to being punctual, we are looking for an engaging, approachable, and empathetic person.</p>
<p>Our ideal candidate not only enjoys teaching someone how to use something new, but they’re energized by sharing their passion for technology. You should be versatile; able to interact with a range of personalities from building owners to tenants to people on the street. This isn’t an office job, so we want someone who enjoys being on the move and is comfortable with physical labor – climbing ladders, carrying equipment, drilling holes, and mounting devices.</p>
<h2 id="what-youll-do">What you’ll do:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Technician will play a significant role in helping to build and design the mesh network infrastructure and plan the locations for installing network hubs and nodes.</li>
<li>The Technician will perform routine residential installations and help the team with our larger infrastructure-building projects as well.</li>
<li>Climbing ladders, carrying tool bags, drilling holes, mounting devices, and learning how to run and terminate low-voltage cable will be common.</li>
<li>Investigate and resolve device and network specific issues at point of installation. Think everything from helping get a wireless printer connected to making sure there’s no interruptions when streaming or gaming.</li>
<li>Educate customers on how to operate the equipment after setup and installation to ensure their long-term success with the service. Excellent communication skills and a thoughtfulness for engaging lay people on technical subjects is a must.</li>
<li>Maintain inventory of gear and procure needed materials/supplies/tools.</li>
<li>Input details into our project management and CRM databases.</li>
<li>Configure and maintain backend device controllers.</li>
<li>Document activities and help codify best practices/training materials.</li>
<li>Attend and co-lead weekly tech team calls.</li>
<li>Co-lead the Technical Advisory Board and coordinate with tech volunteers.</li>
<li>Work with the Admin team to monitor and design project budgets.</li>
<li>Technician reports to the Administrative Project Manager/Executive Director.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="experience-and-skills-required">Experience and skills required:</h2>
<ul>
<li>A demonstrated capacity and enthusiasm for learning new skills. Experience with networking and low-voltage cabling is not required – we expect that these skills can be learned on the job.</li>
<li>Must demonstrate attention to instruction and details.</li>
<li>Must respond well to receiving and giving instruction and feedback.</li>
<li>Ability to work as a part of a team as well as independently and proactively. Must complete tasks with diligence, and be willing to ask questions.</li>
<li>Must be able to lift up to 40 lbs regularly, respond quickly to avoid or mitigate potentially dangerous situations, move safely over uneven terrain, safely climb ladders while carrying up to 40 lbs, and work in inclement weather. Must be able to bend, squat, or stand for prolonged periods of time.</li>
<li>Familiarity with basic hardware tools and comfort using them is a must.</li>
<li>Familiarity with basic computer skills is a must
Must have a valid drivers license.</li>
<li>Above all, must be able to make sound decisions about safety. Must be able to adhere to OSHA safety guidelines and wear personal protective gear correctly.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="preferred-experience">Preferred Experience</h2>
<ul>
<li>Spanish-language skills are a plus.</li>
<li>Experience with networking hardware like routers, cabling, antennas is a plus. Experience with using the command line is a plus</li>
<li>Experience in community organizing or development is a plus.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Benefits</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Employer covered medical and dental</li>

<li>Federally recognized holidays plus Float Holiday (12 total)</li>
<li>Note this is for a full-time position, benefits are subject to change if not full-time.</li>

<p><strong>Time</strong>: Our work week is generally M-F 9:30am-5:30pm, but also weekend depending on scheduling opportunities. We regularly schedule volunteer training and community events on Saturdays. Schedule flexibility for prior and ongoing commitments is negotiable.</p>
