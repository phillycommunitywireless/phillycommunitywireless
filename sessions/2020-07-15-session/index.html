<div class="mw7 center measure pa3">
    <p>In this meeting, we 1) heard from  Reverend Mike Major about his North Philadelphia Collective, 2) discussed potential install sites, and 3) creating jobs through the project. Also, many of us will be attending the <a href="https://amc.alliedmedia.org/">21st Allied Media Conference</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://calledtoservecdc.org/">Reverend Mike Major</a> shared his [white paper][1] where he outlined solutions to the problem of providing fast and free Internet access to 2,000 students. Reverend Mike&rsquo;s background is software development; he also donates his time to revitalizing North Philadelphia. After researching the wide-range of options for addressing digital inclusion in the city, Rev. Mike determined the only workable solution is to provide community-wide WiFi that families can access from inside their homes, with the least amount of invasive installations as possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many conversations are occurring to find potential sites for network infrastructure around the city, including expanding the Free Library of Philadelphia&rsquo;s Hot Spots, as well as identifying communities in need nearby. Many potential problems exist such as liability, trust, and invasiveness that need to be addressed through collaboration with community organizations and leaders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We discussed the potential to create jobs through networking. People will need to be trained to install or maintain equipment as well as create materials; ideally, these technicians would be part of the communities that are served. We are looking to partner with existing workforce initiatives in the city to look into this opportunity further.</p>
</li>
</ol>
