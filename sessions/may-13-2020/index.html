    <p>In this meeting, we heard from 1) Meta Mesh in Pittsburg, 2) Community Tech NY, 3) Andrew Coy in Baltimore, and 4) we discussed some Philly specific planning.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Adam Longwill, part of <a href="https://www.metamesh.org/">Meta Mesh</a>, tells the group about <a href="https://pittmesh.net/">PittMesh</a>, a community wireless network in Pittsburgh under the auspices of non-profit Meta Mesh Wireless Communities. Adam advises that the network installation and maintenance should be left to the non-profit due to the intense work of building the network and the high expenditure of resources needed to educate a community on network maintenance. PittMesh is a small <a href="https://www.landmarkdividend.com/what-is-backhaul/">backhaul network</a> with free bandwidth from Timber (a statewide non-profit), so they do not provide a solution for the last-mile. Instead, there is an access network that works similarly to WiFi. In the process, Adam said that half the battle is won if we have a provider on board, which we do–<a href="https://phillywisper.net/">Philly Wisper</a>! In responding to questions, Adam answered that bandwidth is not an issue; they have 1.5GB which is enough for dozens of users and are scaling up to 10GB.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some members of <a href="http://communitytechny.org/">Community Tech NY</a> discussed their work as well. We learned that line of sight to users is very important for a mesh network and that 30-40 people can be served by a single access point, but this number varies based on the specific hardware equipment used. Based on the constraints of the network, it is important to manage end-user expectations and to understand what are typical use cases  as well. Another avenue we discussed was a mobile wireless truck (akin to an ice cream truck), <a href="https://urbanomnibus.net/2019/10/building-the-peoples-internet/">which costs about $5000</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Andrew Coy, of the Digital Harbor Foundation Baltimore, updated us that eight sites were already deployed, with dozens more being deployed this same week. They have been partnering with schools mainly to set up equipment, gain funding, and to identify families in need.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the Philadelphia specifics were discussed. We would like to use <a href="https://www.ui.com/">Ubiquiti</a> equipment for low failure rate but we are unsure about the best structures to place equipment in the neighborhood: trucks, churches, libraries, public schools and housing were all suggested. For further reading and future steps, take a look at the resources of the <a href="http://communitytechnology.github.io/">Community Technology Coalition</a>.</p>
