<p>Dylan grew up in the Lehigh Valley region of Pennsylvania, just north of Philadelphia. Dylan graduated from Moravian University in the Spring of 2021 with a bachelors of science degree in Public Health and Computer Science.</p>
<p>Shortly after graduation, Dylan moved to the Philadelphia suburbs where he took a job working as an observability and monitoring engineer at a large financial institution. Dylan in the past worked as an emergency medical technician and dispatcher where he discovered his love for community and working with people.</p>
<p>Dylan discovered and joined the Philly Community Wireless project in July of 2022 and was inspired to use his tech skills and love of working with people to help bring internet access to people in Philadelphia. Dylan joined the project as a volunteer and loved the physical installation work of climbing on roofs to install antennas and working with community organizations to expand internet access. Being involved in the great community of North Philadelphia is one of Dylan&rsquo;s favorite parts of the project. Dylan is a firm believer that internet access is a fundamental human right,</p>
<p>Outside of his work with Philly Community Wireless, Dylan is involved in various community action groups, and helps with political and union organizing. Dylan is a Chester County Master Gardener through Penn State Extension. Dylan helps run a community garden in the Philly suburbs where he lives. Dylan likes to walk, hike and bicycle. Dylan&rsquo;s other interests are in the area of sustainable communities, media and telecom technologies, and sustainable local food infrastructure.</p>
